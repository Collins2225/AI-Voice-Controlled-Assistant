 Secure Voice Media Controller

A secure, voice-controlled media assistant with multi-layer authentication and distance-optimized speech recognition.

This project implements a real-time voice interface for system media control, featuring a two-layer security model (voice password + wake word), adaptive microphone calibration, and session-based command execution.

Project Overview

The Secure Voice Media Controller enables hands-free control of system media functions (play, pause, volume, skip, etc.) through voice commands.

Unlike basic voice assistants, this system integrates:

1.Voice-based startup authentication

2. Distance-optimized microphone sensitivity

3.Session-based state management

4.Automatic session timeout for security

5.Wake-word activation

The architecture ensures both usability and security in a real-world audio environment.
